Have you heard of ChatGPT? If not, it's time to catch up with one of the fastest-growing tech products. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT [amassed one million users in just five days](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The name ChatGPT combines "chat" and "GPT," which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, indicating that you are interacting with a sophisticated machine learning model, also known as a large language model (LLM). While we will delve deeper into the concepts of **GPT** and **LLMs** in another technical blog, for now, let's refer to it simply as a machine learning (ML) model.

This ML model is trained on a vast corpus of digitized knowledge to predict and generate text by [continuously determining the next word based on preceding words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) until a designated stop word is reached. There are [numerous models available](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The capabilities of this ML model are remarkable, including generating realistic [images](https://www.midjourney.com/home) and [videos](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine), composing poetry, creating music, completing homework, writing code, and even diagnosing diseases with a [simple prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering). As one of the most transformative technologies of our era, it is influencing various aspects of life, from geopolitics and business to culture. Indeed, portions of this and other blogs on this website have been enhanced by such a chatbot. In the near future, it is likely that any text, image, or video you encounter on the internet or elsewhere will be partly or wholly generated by a machine learning model.

But, here, we are not here to simply talk about LLMs, GPT, AI but take a holistic view on the scientific publications
