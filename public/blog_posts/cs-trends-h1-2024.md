# Introduction

# Large Language Models

Have you heard of ChatGPT? If not, it's time to catch up with one of the fastest-growing tech products. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT [amassed one million users in just five days](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The name ChatGPT combines "chat" and "GPT," which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, indicating that you are interacting with a sophisticated machine learning model. While we will delve deeper into the concepts of **GPT** in another technical blog, for now, we will refer to this sophisticated and VERY _LARGE_ machine learning _model_ to imitate human _lanaguage_, commonly known as a **LLM**.

This ML model is trained on a vast corpus of digitized knowledge to generate text by [continuously determining the next word based on preceding words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) until a designated stop word is reached. There are [numerous models available](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The capabilities of this ML model are remarkable, including generating realistic [images](https://www.midjourney.com/home) and [videos](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine), composing [poetry](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2022/12/20/chatgpt-poems-and-secrets/), creating [music](https://suno.com/), writing [code](https://github.com/features/copilot), and even [diagnosing diseases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00164) with a [simple prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) given in human language. As one of the most transformative technologies of our era, its influencing various aspects of one's life, from marco effects in geopolitics [^4] to micro effects of our everyday interaction with our most beloved device, our phone [^5].

In the near future, it is likely that any text, image, or video you encounter on the internet or elsewhere will be partly or wholly generated by a machine learning model. Indeed, portions of this and other blogs on this website have been enhanced by such a chatbot. Despite the current excitement around Artificial Intelligence and its transformative potential, there are concerns about it leading to a scientific monoculture [^2] and the degradation of scientific inquiry [^3]. Although AI tools can objectively boost productivity, they may also result in reduced learning and understanding. If you have always have an expert by your side, would you ever consider being an expert in anything? It can lead to proliferation of misinformation, loss of jobs. It'll result in an even better tools for scammers to perform identify thefts or simply impersonate a loved one over the phone. For politicians to create targetted political propaganda or terrorists to engineer dangerous biological materials. So much so, every government in the world is racing towards creating a long term governance framework to research, develop, and commercialize the technology [^6].
