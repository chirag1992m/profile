cover_image_prompt: 'A high-definition depiction of a natural lifecycle in a forest setting, suitable for a blog cover image, with a wide aspect ratio. The image illustrates the journey from seed to mature tree, featuring a progression from left to right: a small seed sprouting in rich, dark soil, a young sapling with tender leaves, a tree in full bloom with colorful flowers, and finally, an ancient tree with a thick trunk and sprawling branches, covered in moss and surrounded by fallen leaves. The lush, green forest and soft sunlight filtering through the leaves create a tranquil and detailed atmosphere.'

It's been more than 11 years since I last wrote a [blogpost](https://digital-madness.in/blog/2013/fast-io-in-c/). During my college days, 
I loved taking complex concepts and presenting them in an easy-to-digest format. I used to teach computer subjects to my friends just the 
night before their exam. Despite finding it easy to explain concepts on the fly, I've always struggled with putting my thoughts to written words.

As my career has progressed, I've felt the need to rekindle this passion and work on distilling and writing the things I read, learn, build and 
think about. My goal is not to teach you something specific, but to embark on a journey of learning and self-discovery. If you find something valuable here, 
that would be a wonderful bonus. Because, as Richard Feynman said,

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

# Old website, a new look

Before I started writing again, I wanted a frictionless way to create beautiful blogs and publish them on my own domain, which I've owned for over 15 years but haven't updated or maintained in a long time. The previous website was built with HTML, CSS, and PHP, and the blog was managed via WordPress. It worked fine for its time. However, as web technologies advanced and the variety of devices used to access the web expanded, it couldn't keep up and started to look outdated on different screen sizes.

This led me to search for better programming languages, frameworks, templates, and designs. In a world where instant access to anything is just a click away, building something from scratch remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from various designs I encountered online, I decided to rethink my technical stack. 
My goal were simple and limited to:

* Ensure the website could be hosted on a simple [cPanel-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel) server.
* Writing new blog posts as easy as writing in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), keeping them clean, intutive and easy to read and write.
* The pages should be responsive and give a "journal" feel.
