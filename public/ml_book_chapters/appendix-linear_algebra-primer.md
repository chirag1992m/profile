Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics ... It's widely used in other sciences like physics, chemistry, and is essential for deep learning. 

## Building Blocks

### Scalar
- Single number
- Belonging to a set $ x \in R$
- Graphically shown as a single point on a number line

### Vector
- a group of number arranged in order
- represents a point in space of dimension equal to the size of vector. each element represent the distance on the particular dimension.
- belongs to a cartesian product
- eg: two numbers in a 2-D cartesian plane

### Matrix and Tensor
- 2-D group of numbers arranged in rows and columns
- each column or row is a vector.
- $R^{m \times n}$
- Tensor is a generalization to N-dimensions, $R^{a \times b \times c \times d}$
- Used to represent 3-D objects like an image (3 channels, red, green, blue and each being a matrix)
