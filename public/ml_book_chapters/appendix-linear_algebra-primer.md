Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics ... It's widely used in other sciences like physics, chemistry, and is essential for deep learning.
It's applications in finding answers to linear equations, gives it the name Linear Eequations. It has elements of abstractions and application.

## Building Blocks

### Scalar

-   Single number
-   Belonging to a set $ x \in R$
-   Graphically shown as a single point on a number line

### Vector

-   a group of number arranged in order
-   represents a point in space of dimension equal to the size of vector. each element represent the distance on the particular dimension.
-   belongs to a cartesian product
-   eg: two numbers in a 2-D cartesian plane
-   row-vector and column-vector.

### Matrix and Tensor

-   2-D group of numbers arranged in rows and columns
-   each column or row is a vector. set of column-vectors / row-vectors.
-   $R^{m \times n}$
-   Tensor is a generalization to N-dimensions, $R^{a \times b \times c \times d}$
-   Used to represent 3-D objects like an image (3 channels, red, green, blue and each being a matrix)
